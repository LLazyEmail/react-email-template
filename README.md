# yarn add react-email-components-template

We have issues with renderting templates right now.
There different things that should be concidered as done in order to make it work great for all 

Example `React` component "library" using [`rollup`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) that is published to `npm`.

```
title (string, required) - Used by clients if email is opened in a web page.
previewText (string, required) - Short description that appears in email clients
headCSS (string, optional) - CSS that belongs in `<head>`. Note, email clients may strip this out.
bgColor (string, optional) - The background color for the email. '#FFFFFF' is the default
lang (string, optional) - ISO language code
dir (string, optional) - Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. 'ltr' is the default
```
